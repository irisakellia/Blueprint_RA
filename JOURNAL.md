## 10/23/2025 - Completed robotic arm model & final renders  

This week I finalized the 3D robotic arm in Blender. I refined the gripper mechanism, optimized the geometry for smooth animation, and added a three-point lighting setup for high-quality renders. I also prepared multiple export formats (OBJ, STL) and organized the project files for GitHub publication. The final animation and lighting turned out great, giving the model a professional look.![render-side.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDY1NSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--ff72f24978ec107d92a716e93fb44d57bd0877a5/render-side.png)
